In C#, every variable has the specifit structure, the structure decides the RAM and the layout. The range can be stored in the RAM, also can
do some operation for variable.

C# can define other variables, like enum, also allow it defines other variable types, like class. 
The gramma for difining the variable:
<data_type> <variable_list>;

the Variable intialization
variable_name = value;
for instance:


using System;

namespace VariableDefinition
{
    class program
    {
        static void Main(String[] args)
        {
            short a;
            int b;
            double c;

            a = 10;
            b = 20;
            c = a + b;
            Console.WriteLine("a = {0}, b = {1}, c ={2}, a, b, c);
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
